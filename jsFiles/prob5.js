// Write a function that, 
// takes an array of integers as input
// itearates over the arra
// returns a new array.

// The returned array should contain the result of raising 2 to the power of the original input element.
// For example,([1,2,3]) returns [2,4,8] because 2 ^ 1 = 2, 2 ^ 2 = 4, and 2 ^ 3 = 8.
// Use for and forEach and then map to solve this question to see the difference between the three ways
